# Two Sum â€“ Java Solution

This repository contains a clean Java solution to the **Two Sum** problem, commonly found on coding platforms like LeetCode.

## ðŸ§  Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example

```java
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
