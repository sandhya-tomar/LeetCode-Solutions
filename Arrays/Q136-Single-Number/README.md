# Single Number (LeetCode 136)

## 📝 Problem Description

Given a **non-empty** integer array `nums`, every element appears **twice** except for one.  
Find that **single one**.

You must implement a solution with:
- **Linear runtime complexity (O(n))**
- **Constant extra space (O(1))**

---

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
- `-3 * 10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10⁴`
- Each element in the array appears **twice** except for one element which appears **only once**

---

## 💡 Example

### Input
```java
nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
