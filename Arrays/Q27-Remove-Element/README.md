# Remove Element

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer value `val`, remove all instances of that value **in-place** and return the new length of the array.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array **in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,,]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
