ðŸ“˜ LeetCode Solutions
A beginner-friendly collection of my LeetCode problem solutions, written in Java. This repository marks the start of my journey into data structures and algorithms, currently focusing on arrays and strings.

ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each folder represents a topic (e.g., Strings, Arrays), and each file inside is a Java solution to a specific problem.

ðŸ§  Topics Covered (So Far)
âœ… Arrays
âœ… Strings

ðŸ“Œ More topics like Linked Lists, Trees, and Dynamic Programming will be added as I progress.
